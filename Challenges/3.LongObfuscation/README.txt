Congrats! Now instead of just finding an address, let's try to use Ghidra to understand what some code is doing. This binary <link here> is a portion of a program which obfuscates (not encrypts!) data. Analyze this binary in Ghidra using the same parameters as before. We want to look for opcodes that are changing data, instead of just moving it around. What opcode here actually changes the data it operates on?
Answer: XOR
