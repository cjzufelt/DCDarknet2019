Challenge 4: Here is a portion of a program with a somewhat more complicated obfuscation algorithm. Understand the algorithm, then operate on this data to recover the original message (order of operations is important!) <include data here. Have your code XOR, then ADD, then reverse the byte endianness [i.e. - 5A -> A5]. This will be the first significantly difficult problem, in case DC DarkNet team assigns different numbers of points for each problem>.
