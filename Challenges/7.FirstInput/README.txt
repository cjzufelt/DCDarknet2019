Challenge 6: <this should be a program that has a menu and looks for user input to decide what branch to take. One branch should just exit the program, one should print some message to the screen "Welcome"?, and then there should be an option which isn't listed in the menu text, but which does something more interesting like prompt the user for data and then obfuscate it, or print some random data that your program provides a seed for [so everyone would see the same thing]. What needs to be entered by the user to access the hidden function should be unprintable hex that they can't enter with a keyboard.> This binary is a slightly more complicated program. Let's see if we can understand it. Try to find where the interesting code starts. This program has a user interface of sorts, but there is functionality that isn't advertised to the user. What data is displayed to the user when they activate this functionality?
Answer: Root access granted
