Challenge 8: Having used Ghidra to identify where the hidden functionality is located, let's restore it. For this quest, you'll need to use Ghidra to identify an address, and then use a hex editor to modify that address. In the previous exercise, you found that the hidden functionality requires an unprintable hex value to be entered. There are different ways of dynamically accessing this functionality, but for this exercise, try to modify the hex value to an ASCII value of your choice (always edit a copy of your binary, not the original!). Now when you run the program, you can enter this ASCII value to get the program to execute the "hidden" path. For large programs, you will be able to reverse engineer functionality much more quickly when you use a combination of static (Ghidra) and dynamic (execute the binary, usually in a VM or sandbox) analysis. In order to dynamically access the hidden functionality, what address, according to Ghidra, must be altered?
